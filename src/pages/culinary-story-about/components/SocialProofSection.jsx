      review: `Savoria exceeded every expectation I had. Chef Isabella's attention to detail and passion for quality ingredients shines through in every dish. The seasonal menu perfectly captures the essence of California cuisine with Mediterranean influences.\n\nThe service was impeccable, and the atmosphere strikes the perfect balance between elegant and welcoming. This is exactly what neighborhood dining should beâ€”exceptional food in a warm, inviting setting.`,

      review: `I've been dining at Savoria since they opened, and they continue to impress me with their consistency and innovation. The staff knows my preferences, and Chef Isabella often surprises me with off-menu creations that perfectly match my taste.\n\nWhat sets Savoria apart is their genuine care for the community. They source locally, support other small businesses, and create a space where neighbors become friends over incredible food.`,

      review: `Savoria catered our company's annual celebration, and the experience was flawless from start to finish. The team worked with us to create a custom menu that impressed our clients and colleagues alike.\n\nThe presentation was stunning, the flavors were exceptional, and the service was professional yet warm. Several attendees have already asked for Savoria's contact information for their own events.`,

      review: `James, the sommelier, is absolutely brilliant. His wine pairings elevated our dining experience to new heights. Each selection perfectly complemented the flavors of our dishes, and his knowledge and passion for wine made the evening educational as well as delicious.\n\nThe wine list is thoughtfully curated with options for every palate and budget. This is a restaurant that truly understands the art of food and wine pairing.`,
